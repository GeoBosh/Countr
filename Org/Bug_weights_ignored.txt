Hi Georgi,

I will attach an rscript file with an example of something that I am trying to do. Hopefully this 
helps.

Thanks,
Bryce

Hi Bryce,
 
I will look into this. It may take a couple of days since I can’t see the reason outright. You descried the 
issue well but it will be helpful if you send me an example of the issue. 
 
 
Thanks,
Georgi

Hi Georgi,
 
Thanks for your help a couple weeks ago. Setting xtimes to 1 was able to solve my issue and 
was able to build some helpful models with the package. I just have one final question. I was 
trying to use the weights= option in the renewalcount  function with a weibull distribution, but 
when it seems to not be using the weights I pass through. I made sure to make the weights the 
same length as the data set being passed in, but when I look at the output from the model it says 
the weights are all equal to 1. There are no errors being returned, it just seems to be ignoring the 
weights I am trying to give it. The coefficients for any covariates I also add do not change 
whether there are weights or not added to the renewalcount function. I feel like there might be 
something I am missing but I can't figure it out. Any suggestions to try would be awesome. Also 
thanks again for your help a couple weeks ago. 
 
Thanks,
Bryce

Hi Bryce,
 
I will investigate the problem with installation of Countr from bitbucket, I get it as well but can’t see 
immediately where the problem is since the error message doesn’t give the file name. 
 
Please note that the error:
 
"Error in order(-value, xtimes) : object 'xtimes' not found"
 
is caused by recent versions of package ‘optimx’, see
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52927399/renewalcount-function-in-countr
 
That can be resolved by installing a version of optimx before 2018-7.10. Alternatively do
 
xtimes <- 1
 
before calling our functions. I don’t know why optimx uses stuff that works only on linux. We could 
patch it on our side but this is a dangerous thing to do (although if optimx doesn’t resolve it, we will 
do it). 
 
Thanks for using Countr,
Georgi

Hi Bryce,
 
It seems that the issue you have is related to Windows and nothing to do with the package 
itself.  
 
I am cc Georgi to this email. He knows more about Windows than myself. Maybe he will be 
able to help.
 
Best,
Tarak

Hi Tarak, 
 
I have tried to download the latest development of Countr that you had linked above, but am 
running into an issue when installing.
 
Here is the code that i have used to try and install:
 
library(devtools)
install_bitbucket("tkharrat/countr_project")
 
This is what happens when I try to install it:
 
Downloading bitbucket repo tkharrat/countr_project@master
?  checking for file 
'C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\RtmpE5uBOY\remotes642411c96d\tkharrat-
countr_project-31ca44b78db1/DESCRIPTION' (423ms)
   Warning in file.copy(pkgname, Tdir, recursive = TRUE, copy.date = TRUE) :
     over-long path length
    ERROR
   copying to build directory failed
Error in (function (command = NULL, args = character(), error_on_status = TRUE,  : 
  System command error
 
From what I understand this is happening because of a file path being too long. If there is 
another way of downloading the package or fixing this issue, as I don't have too much 
experience with using the devtools, that would be great.
 
I will also include my session info below:

Hi Bryce,
 
Thanks for your interest in our work.
 
I would strongly to install the latest development version of Countr available here:
https://bitbucket.org/tkharrat/countr_project
 
You can use devtools for that. If you still see the issue, please send over some info about 
your session (sessionInfo()) and hopefully me or Gerogi would be able to help.
 
Best wishes,
Tarak

Hi Dr. Tarak Kharrat, 
 
I have been trying to test and mess around with football modeling in the premiere league and 
have come across some of your work, especially surrounding the use of the bivariate weibull 
count model. I have also come across the package in R, that I believe you have created, called 
the Countr package. I have come across the paper you wrote along with Georgi N. Boshnakov 
titled "Football data analysis an example with the Countr package" an have tried to follow the 
example that was written. 
 
I have run into an error when trying run this example in R for the weibull-count-model. I have 
run all the code in the paper noted above, but when i try to run the code to create the 
away_wei variable I keep getting an error message. The message I keep getting is: 
"Error in order(-value, xtimes) : object 'xtimes' not found"
I was wondering if you have seen this issue before and can recommend how to solve this 
error. I have messed around with the renewalCount function some and even tried my own data 
set, but keep getting the same error message. Any help in solving this issue would be greatly 
appreciated. 
 
Thanks,
Bryce Burdge
