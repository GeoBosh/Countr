Description: Flexible univariate count models based on renewal processes. The
    models may include covariates and can be specified with familiar formula
    syntax as in glm() and package 'flexsurv'.  The methodology is described by
    Kharrat et all (2019) <doi:10.18637/jss.v090.i13> (included as vignette
    'Countr_guide' in the package).
