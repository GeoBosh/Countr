Description: Flexible univariate count models based on renewal
    processes. The models may include covariates and can be specified
    with familiar formula syntax as in glm() and package 'flexsurv'.
    The methodology is described in a forthcoming paper in the Journal
    of Statistical Software (included as vignette 'Countr_guide').
