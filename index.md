# Overview

Flexible univariate count models based on renewal processes. The models
may include covariates and can be specified with familiar formula syntax
as in [`glm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/glm.html) and package
‘flexsurv’. The methodology is described in a paper in the Journal of
Statistical Software. The paper is included as vignette
`vignette("Countr_guide")` along wth several additional vignettes
containing worked examples and additional details, see [Countr CRAN
page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Countr).

The package is developed by Tarak Kharrat and Georgi N.Boshnakov.
